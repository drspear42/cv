    <h3>My hobbies</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The gym. I take great pride in my physique and wish to see my genetic limit one day, I am fully focused on aesthetic in the gym.
      </li>
      <li>
        I like shows and movies. My standards are not high and I enjoy a wide variety of movies and shows
      </li>
      <li>
        Stock Trading. I trade both shares and contracts (puts/calls, sometimes in strategies like calendar spreads and box spreads)
      </li>
      <li>
        I play videogames. I used to play a lot more videogames, but recently in the last year ive played significantly less of them, sometimes going a month or so without playing. I still enjoy them however and am a fan of the gaming community.
      </li>

        I don't swim often, but I greatly enjoy swimming. I used to be on a swim team, and was quite good at it. I have good genetics for it.

      <li>
        Work in progress really. I am still trying to figure out what and who I am. I communicate a lot on discord, and have just begun to code; my life is taking a weird turn but I'm enjoying the ride.
